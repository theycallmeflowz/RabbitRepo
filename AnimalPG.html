  <p> The Lionhead Rabbit is a relatively new rabbit breed within the United States of America. Although the breed had been imported around 1998, it was not until 2014 that the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) approved the Lionhead Rabbit as an officially recognized breed. In contrast, the United Kingdom’s British Rabbit Council (BRC) already recognized all known colours and varieties of the breed, in 2002.
In the United States, according to the ARBA Standards, the Lionhead Rabbit is recognized in the following colors and varieties: Tortoise (Black, Blue, Chocolate, Lilac) and Ruby Eyed White (REW), Chocolate & Seal.</p>

  <h2>What is a Lionhead Rabbit?</h2>
  <hr>
    <p>

      Lionhead Rabbits are small bunnies with compact, rounded bodies and are considered to be a fancy breed. The distinguishing factor between Lionhead bunnies and other breeds is that this breed has a “wool mane”. The similarity they share with the king of the animal kingdom, the Lion, is the reason that they were given their breed name. Normally, their mane is around 2 inches (5 cm) long. Lionheads are not only cute and perky, they are very good-natured bunnies who are also tolerant of children as well, and as such, they make wonderful pets for kids and adults alike. They also tend to be well-mannered, friendly, and easily trained. Learn more about their temperament!
